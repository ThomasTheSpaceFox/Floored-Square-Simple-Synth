FSSS HELP
FSSS is an array-based software synth programmed in python using pygame.


Controls come in two types:

Live:
	Key Multi-trigger: starts a background thread that calls the note multiple times if greater than 1 (default)
	[alt+ 1,2,3]

	Note Vol: a float that controls the volume of the generated note samples.
	[pageup, pagedown (hold shift for fine control)]

	Note Fadein time: Note fade-in time measured in miliseconds.
	[Left, Right (hold shift for fine control)]

	Note Fadeout time: Note fade-out time measured in miliseconds
	[Up, down (hold shift for fine control)]
Non-live (samples must be re-generated for changes to take effect):
	Stack Synth: Controls the method used when stacking notes of multiple octaves.
	[shift+ A,S,D,F,G,H]
		Additive [A]: Add the values
	Octave Stacking: Controls the number of octaves to stack in each note sample.
	[shift+1,2,3,4,5]
	Square Method: Method used to square the basewave
	[
